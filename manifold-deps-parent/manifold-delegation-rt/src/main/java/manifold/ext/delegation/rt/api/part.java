/**
 * When combined with the {@link link} annotation, a part class is a building block for interface composition & <i>true</i>
 * delegation. A part class may also be used as a regular class anywhere you would normally use a class.
 * <p/>
 * When used for delegation, one or more fields of a class are marked with {@code @link} where each is assigned an instance
 * of a {@code part} class. The field's enclosing class, called the linking class, delegates the implementation of linked
 * interfaces to a {@code part} class, where the linking class can override methods in the link. In turn, linked interfaces
 * invoked from the {@code part} class are also polymorphic with respect to the linking class. As with sub/super classes,
 * linked interface method calls are polymorphic both going it and out of a {@code part} class.
