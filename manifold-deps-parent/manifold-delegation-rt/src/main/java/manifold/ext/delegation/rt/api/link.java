 * Use {@code @link} to automatically transfer calls on unimplemented interface methods to fields in the same class.
 * <ul>
 * <li> Choose between call forwarding and true delegation with {@code @part} </li>
 * <li> Override linked interface methods, optionally using {@link part} classes (solves <a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~lieber/Lieberary/OOP/Delegation/Delegation.html">the Self problem</a>) </li></li>
 * <li> Share super interface implementations (solves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem">the Diamond problem</a>)</li>
 * <li> Configure class implementation dynamically</li>

 * Classes and links are many-to-many: Many of a class's interfaces may be linked to a single field. A single class may
 * have many linked fields.
