/**
 * Serves as the pseudo keyword {@code auto}, which declares a field, local, or method as having its type inferred from
 * its value/definition.
 * <p/>
 * A field or local variable declared as {@code auto} infers its type from the initializer. The behavior is similar to
 * Java's 'var'.
 * <p/>
 * A method with return type {@code auto} infers its return type from the return statements in its definition. As a
 * consequence, fields and methods declared in the inferred type are type-safely accessible to call-sites.
