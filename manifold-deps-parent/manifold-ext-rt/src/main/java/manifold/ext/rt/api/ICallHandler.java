 * Facilitates dynamic interface method invocation.

 * A class can directly or indirectly, via interface extension, implement this
 * interface to support dynamic interface method invocation.  Any class implementing
 * this interface can be cast to <i>any</i> interface.  Manifold cooperates
 * with the Java compiler to transform calls through an interface to
 * ICallHandler.call().
 * <p/>
 * Note unlike a proxy or wrapper a class implementing ICallHandler
 * doesn't wrap anything, therefore it doesn't lose its identity in the process
 * of making calls.
