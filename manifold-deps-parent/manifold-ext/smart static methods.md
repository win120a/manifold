Occasionally, albeit mostly for generated code, I run into cases where "smart" static methods would be helpful. Most
recently
to access empty arrays.

With the Java language it's common to return an empty array as a default value to avoid returning null.

```java
interface Foo {
  default String[] brands() { return new String[0]; }
}
```

But we don't want to construct a new empty array each time the method is called, instead we create a constant.

```java
interface Foo {
  String[] EMPTY_STRING_ARRAY = new String[0];

  default String[] brands() { return EMPTY_STRING_ARRAY; }
}
```

But we also don't want to have multiple versions of the same empty array, so we put this constant where it can be
reused.

```java
public class EmptyArrays {
  public static final String[] EMPTY_STRING_ARRAY = new String[0];
}

interface Foo {
  default String[] brands() { return EmptyArrays.EMPTY_STRING_ARRAY; }
}
```

This is a common Java idiom.

The code I _want_ to write:

```java
interface Foo {
  default String[] brands() { return String.emptyArray(); }
}
```

Where `emptyArray()` is a "smart" static method on `Object`. Something like:

```java
public class Object {
  public static This[] emptyArray() {
    return new This[0]; // cached in real-life
  }
}
```

The imagined `This` is the static counterpart to `this` and can be used as a type reference, much like a generic type
variable
with the added bonus of reification.

Along the same lines virtual static methods could be useful too. Just a thought.
