/**
 * Designates a field declaration as a read-only property.
 * <p/>
 * <pre><code>
 * {@literal @}val String name; // a public read-only property
 * </code></pre>
 * You use the property directly as declared:
 * <p/>
 * <pre><code>
 * String theName = foo.name; // compiles as a call to foo.getName()
 * </code></pre>
 * When used in an interface the property is public and abstract, a public getter is generated. If the property is
 * initialized, the getter is {@code default} and returns the initialized value.
 * <p/>
 * When used in a class the property is public by default, a private final backing field is generated having the same
 * name, and a public getter is generated returning the field. The property must be initialized either in its
 * declaration or in the constructor(s).
 * <p/>
 * A property can be declared with {@code static}. When used in a class, the same rules apply as non-static. Static
 * interface properties, however, must always be calculated -- getter/setter methods must be provided.
 * <p/>
 * Note, the {@code final} and {@code abstract} modifiers can be used in a property declaration; they apply to the
 * getter/setter accessor methods. Thus, if there are user-defined getter/setter methods corresponding with the
 * property, they must reflect the modifiers from the property.
 * <p/>
