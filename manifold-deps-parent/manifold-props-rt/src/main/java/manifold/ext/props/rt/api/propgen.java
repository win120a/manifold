/**
 * <h2>For internal use only.</h2>
 * <p/>
 * This annotation preserves declared state of a {@code @}{@link var} field on the property's corresponding accessor
 * method[s]. In the case of property that must have a backing field, the {@link #flags} store the field's access so it
 * can be changed to {@code private} access in bytecode and then restored to the originally declared access during
 * compilation immediately after the declaring type's .class file is loaded. Similarly, when a property does not have a
 * backing field, {@link var}, {@link get}, and {@link set} are used to recreate the erased symbol.
