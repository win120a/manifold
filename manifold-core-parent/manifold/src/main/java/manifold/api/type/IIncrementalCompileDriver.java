/**
 * Facilitates incremental compilation and hot swap debugging of Manifold resource files.
 * <p/>
 * The implementation of this interface is provided to Manifold during javac compilation.
 * It is provided by name (typically) using a generated, temporary Java source file annotated with
 * {@link IncrementalCompile}.  Typically an IDE hosting an incremental compiler using
 * Javac will keep track of the set of changed resource files needing compilation and generate
 * this temporary Java class. Thus an implementor of this interface acts as a mediator so that:
 * <ul>
 *   <li>the incremental compiler of the IDE can communicate the set of changed resource files to Manifold (via {@link #getChangedFiles()})</li>
 *   <li>Manifold can add the types associated with the resource files to javac's queue of types to be compiled </li>
 *   <li>Manifold can communicate back to the IDE the set of types via IjChangedResourceFiles#getTypesToFile()</li>
 * </ul>
