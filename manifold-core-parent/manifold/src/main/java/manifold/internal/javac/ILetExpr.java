 * The LetExpr has evolved a little over time regarding the declared type of {@link LetExpr#defs} and

 * features such as operator overloading and properties. In some cases, such as properties, we need the LetExpr to
 * have defs that are not JCVarDecl e.g., setXxx() to handle JCAssignOp. All of this mumbo jumbo here and in LetExpr_8
 * and LetExpr_11 is to make that work.
